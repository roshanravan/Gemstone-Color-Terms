# Distinguishing the Extraordinary: Trade Color Terms in Gemstones – Origins, Laboratory Criteria, and Ethical Debates

## Introduction
Within the vibrant world of gemstones, certain evocative trade color terms have long served to designate only the most exquisite specimens. These are poetic, non-scientific names—think *“pigeon’s blood red”* for the most sought-after rubies, *“royal blue”* for top-tier sapphires, or *“Jedi”* for exceptionally vivid spinels.

Historically, these descriptors emerged as lyrical ways to capture extraordinary color and quality, and they wield considerable marketing influence; a gem adorned with the *“pigeon’s blood”* or *“royal blue”* label can command a significant premium.

In recent years, gemological laboratories have increasingly been tasked with endorsing these traditional trade names on official reports. However, this practice is not without controversy. The absence of a universal standard has led to differing criteria among laboratories.  

This article explores:
- The **origins and meanings** of major trade color terms
- How **leading gem labs define them**
- The **advisability and ethical implications** of laboratories employing such names

## Criteria Used by Major Gemological Laboratories

| Laboratory     | Criteria for Trade Terms |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| **SSEF & Gübelin** | - Extremely strict (color + quality) <br> - Must be untreated <br> - “Pigeon’s blood” requires strong fluorescence <br> - “Royal blue” must be vivid, untreated, fine clarity <br> - Very few stones qualify |
| **GRS** | - More inclusive, pioneered “pigeon’s blood” on reports <br> - Color-driven: vivid red or vivid blue only <br> - Origin not restricted (Mozambique accepted) <br> - Heated stones allowed <br> - Broader interpretation, democratized use |

---

## Ethical & Market Debates
- **Proponents argue:**  
  - Adds marketing power and prestige  
  - Helps consumers identify extraordinary quality  

- **Critics argue:**  
  - No universal standard → inconsistency  
  - Misleads consumers if labs differ in criteria  
  - Dilutes historical meaning of terms  

**Key Question:** Should gem labs act as custodians of tradition, or adapt to modern markets with flexible interpretations?

---

## Conclusion
Trade color terms like *“pigeon’s blood”*, *“royal blue”*, and *“paraíba”* remain among the most influential—and controversial—labels in the gemstone world.  

While they elevate a stone’s prestige and market value, inconsistent criteria and ethical concerns make their use a subject of ongoing debate.  

Ultimately, these terms straddle a fine line: **romantic marketing tools or misleading exaggerations**—their legacy depends on how responsibly laboratories and dealers use them.
