# Distinguishing the Extraordinary: Trade Color Terms in Gemstones – Origins, Laboratory Criteria, and Ethical Debates

## Introduction
Within the vibrant world of gemstones, certain evocative **trade color terms** have long served to designate only the most exquisite specimens. These poetic, non-scientific names—think *“pigeon’s blood red”* for rubies, *“royal blue”* for sapphires, or *“Jedi”* for vivid spinels—carry significant marketing weight and prestige.

Their inclusion on lab reports has sparked controversy: **no universal standard** exists, labs apply divergent criteria, and misuse risks confusing buyers. This guide unpacks origins, lab practices, ethics, and debates.

<summary><b>Notable Trade Color Terms and Their Origins</b></summary>

### Pigeon’s Blood Ruby
- Ideal fine red color; pure, intensely saturated red with strong fluorescence.  
- Origin: Mogok, Myanmar (*ko-twe* = “pigeon’s blood”).  
- Distinctive “inner glow” from high chromium, low iron.  
- Now applied beyond Mogok.

### Royal Blue Sapphire
- Deep, richly saturated blue, minimal gray/green.  
- Historically Mogok & Kashmir; associated with royal jewels.  
- Sri Lankan & Madagascan stones may qualify.

### Cornflower Blue Sapphire
- Medium-light, pure blue, slightly violet-tinged.  
- Synonymous with Kashmir sapphires; velvety tone.  

### Padparadscha Sapphire
- Pinkish-orange to orangey-pink pastel.  
- Origin: Sri Lanka (*padma radschen* = lotus blossom).  
- LMHC standardized definition (2011).  

### Jedi Spinel
- Neon red/pink spinel, coined by Vincent Pardieu (2000s).  
- Electric glow, no dark tones.  

### Paraíba Tourmaline
- Copper-bearing neon blue/green, discovered in Brazil (1980s).  
- Expanded to Mozambique & Nigeria; LMHC formalized (2012).  

### Tsavorite Garnet
- Bright green grossular garnet, discovered in Kenya.  
- Marketed by Tiffany & Co. (1974).  

### Mandarin Garnet
- Pure orange spessartine garnet.  
- First from Namibia (1990s); fiery saturation.  

### Imperial Jade & Topaz
- Imperial Jade: Finest jadeite jade, saturated emerald green, translucent.  
- Imperial Topaz: Orangey-pink/reddish-orange, tied to Russian Czars.

<summary><b>Criteria Used by Major Gemological Laboratories</b></summary>

| Laboratory     | Approach & Criteria |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **SSEF & Gübelin** | Strict, harmonized standards (since 2015). <br> Untreated stones only. <br> Strong fluorescence required for rubies. <br> Conservative; very few qualify. |
| **GRS** | Pioneered “Pigeon’s Blood” on reports (1990s). <br> Inclusive, color-driven. <br> Heated stones allowed. <br> Origin unrestricted. <br> Democratized use, diluted exclusivity. |
| **GIA** | Historically avoided fanciful terms. <br> Now mentions them in **comment fields**, not main report. <br> Only for natural, untreated top-color gems. |
| **AGL** | Objective numeric grading. <br> Avoids trade terms on certificates. <br> May issue appended explanatory letters. <br> Reputation as a “buyer’s lab.” |
| **Others (GIT, LMHC, CIBJO)** | LMHC standardized **Padparadscha (2011)** and **Paraíba (2012)**. <br> Struggled with “Pigeon’s Blood” and “Royal Blue.” <br> CIBJO urges clarity and restraint. |

<summary><b>Ethical & Market Debates</b></summary>

### Benefits
- Certify that a gem meets legendary standards.  
- Powerful shorthand for auction and retail.  
- Adds transparency when backed by master stones.  
- Bridges historical romance and modern gemology.  

### Problems
- Misuse & dilution (e.g., 90% of rubies called “pigeon’s blood” in some markets).  
- “Race to the Bottom”: Labs compete for leniency.  
- Loss of exclusivity and meaning.  
- Lab shopping erodes consumer trust.  
- Labs risk becoming marketers instead of neutral certifiers.  
- Echoes “blue-white diamond” deception (banned 1938).

<summary><b>Path Forward: Standardization & Restraint</b></summary>

- **Expand LMHC harmonization** across more terms.  
- Apply terms only to truly exceptional gems.  
- Explore **origin-linked appellations** (e.g., “Mogok Pigeon’s Blood”).  
- Publish transparent, consistent lab criteria.  
- Avoid blurring certification with marketing.
